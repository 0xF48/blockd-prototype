* Each unit can have up to X amount of dice (dots) and up to Y amount of action points (circle split into 4 parts).
* Units can move all the dice to adjacent friendly units but clicking on the unit and then clicking on any adjacent (touching) friendly unit.
* Units can attack enemy units by click on a unit and then clicking on adjacent enemy unit. a 1-6 dice is rolled for each dot. so if a unit has 1 dot you roll the dice one time, if you have to you roll it twice, etc..
* Each action takes up 1 action point, if you move a unit to an empty, move dice to friendly unit, attack another unit, or change unit type.
* Units can change their type which takes up one action point, simply __select a unit and press 1,2,3.__
* press space to end your turn
